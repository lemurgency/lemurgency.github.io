Pat and I can play games forever. Twenty games of ping pong in a row is nothing out of the ordinary. My excellence at board games most likely stemmed from my days as a youngster watching Pat play Risk with his friends. Pat is a web developer with an interest in technology. I have always looked up to this interest and am also trying to pursue a career as a developer. Pat has always lived a little distant from me. When I was young he lived in Chicago (Not far, but still far enough) and then moved to New Jersey. 

As I became more serious with web development, Pat and I have started a new bond that has brought us a closer despite our physical distance. I'm very excited for this. I miss you Pat.
