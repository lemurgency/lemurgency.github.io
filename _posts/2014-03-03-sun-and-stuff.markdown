Kyle and I have grown closer throughout my college career. He also inherited my mother's ability to talk. We can talk about food, nutrition, our futures, and just about anything regarding out life. Kyle is a people person and always makes me feel welcome. He's very outgoing and can make a table full of people laugh without even trying. His impersonations may not be spot-on, but they are without a doubt entertaining to listen to. 

I miss hanging all the fun times we've had watching a movie, playing games, chatting, and having dinner together. I'm sorry I moved across the country, but soon I'll be back and we can once again hang out!
