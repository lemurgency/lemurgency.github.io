This is my father and my grandfather

My father has always been a major role model in my life. I want to have a business of my own because of him. He is a successful Attorney that took on the challenges of starting his own firm. I have learned a great deal from my father and owe my socratic questioning (and arguing skills), my love for nature, my passion for stupid jokes, and my ability to excel at games. I'm sorry I win. I see a man that worked hard since he was a boy and hasn't stopped since. I respect that, which makes it very hard for me considering I don't have a job right now. I want to follow in his footsteps, but I am following my gut. I hope my gut is right. 

I miss you bantering me to play games, you catching my puns, and our solving of random/useless math problems. I look up to you and you are the best father I could have. I miss you Dad.
