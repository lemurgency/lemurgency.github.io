This is my mother

That second picture is the look I receive after dishing out one of my crazy ideas. My mother is always there to listen to what I have to say. Sometimes we aren't on the same page, but she's always willing to try and understand. She has passed on to me a unique view on the world. Everyday I become more and more aware of the little things she has said to me that I use in my life. She is always smiling and excited about something. She'll talk to anyone about anything 

I miss the time we spend together cooking, walking the dog, and discussing life. I love to think about life and the way everything interacts and I believe that is largely influenced by my mother. She is adventurous and always willing to try new things. Compared to her I am a hermit, but because of her I've developed an open mind towards everything I discover. You are the best mother I could ask for. I miss you Mom.
