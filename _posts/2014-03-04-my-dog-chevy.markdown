This is my dog Chevy. I convinced my parents to get her when I was in 7th grade. She doesn't really treat other dogs with the respect they deserve, but that's only because she wants to protect our family. The look on that dogs face when you go for a walk is a joy that cannot be described. We had a lot of time to ourselves and I grew very attached. I miss her presence the most as I cannot talk to or communicate with her. Enjoy the snow girlie!
