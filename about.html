 			<h3> Hello! </h3>
 			
 			<p> My name is Spenser Filler. I love spending time outside, discovering new things, and web development. I enjoy hiking, walking the my dog Chevy, camping, swimming, disc golf, regular golf, and just about anything that lets me spend some time in the sun. </p>
 			
 			<p> I recently graduated from the university of Illinois with a degree in Technical Systems Management. I love to learn about how different things interact with each other. My major focused mainly on agricultural and renewable energy systems, but I have discovered that everything in life is a system and I want to learn more. After graduating I decided to move down to Panama City Florida where my best friend Jann is stationed. Sometimes I miss being back in Illinois, but then I just go outside in a t-shirt and relax! </p>
 			
 			<p> For now, I am focusing on web systems. I have studied some Ruby and a little bit of Ruby on Rails, but am currently improving my html/css skills. My goal is to become familiar with the different parts of Ruby on Rails and eventually learn to build systems with it. </p>

			<p> My current goals are to learn more about Jekyll and Github-pages which this site is built on. I want to have the capability to launch a basic website from scratch. During all of this I plan on continuing my practice with Ruby so I can eventually takle Ruby on Rails. </p>

			<p> I don't always take selfies, but when I do, I've graduated!
